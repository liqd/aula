-- saying `moderator`; ST should change into an ADT that has a constructor for EventLogItems, but
-- also other constructors for things like `disk full`.  The logger can then have several targets
-- (moderator event log, syslog, admin email, devops email, ...), and decide what to do with each
-- event based on its type.
