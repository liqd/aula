--  Type parameters for this module are 'U' and 'S'.  Fixing them
-- is necessary as a workaround for an issue of 'dericeSafeCopy'.
--
--  The deriveSafeCopy can not add the Ord constraints when
-- creating the SafeCopy class for the 'DelegationMap S U'.  The
-- constraints are necessary to copy the inner map.
--
--  The type constants U and S are created to be able to make this
-- module parametric easier when the issue is resolved.
